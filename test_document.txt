PowerPoint Presentation Context Document

This document provides context for enhancing PowerPoint shape naming.

Project Overview:
The MCP PowerPoint project aims to improve business presentations through intelligent shape naming.
Shapes should have meaningful, descriptive names that reflect their content and purpose.

Common Shape Types:
- Title boxes should be named based on the title content
- Content boxes should reflect the information they contain
- Charts and graphs should indicate the data they represent
- Images should describe what they show

Best Practices:
- Use snake_case for shape names
- Include the slide purpose in shape names
- Avoid generic names like "Rectangle 1" or "TextBox 2"
- Make names searchable and meaningful

Example Transformations:
- "Rectangle 1" → "project_status_title"
- "TextBox 2" → "quarterly_revenue_summary"
- "Picture 3" → "team_org_chart"
